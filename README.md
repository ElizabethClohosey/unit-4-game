Snow Crystals Collector 

This is My fourth assignment for the UNC Fullstack Coding Bootcamp.  This was my favorite assignment so far.  

The point of this assignment was to create an interactive game using javaScript and jQuery.

Instructions:

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four snowflakes on the page. By clicking on a snowflake you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching "Total Snowflakes Collected" to  "Snowflakes To Collect". You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

This game was built using
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
jQuery - JavaScript Library
